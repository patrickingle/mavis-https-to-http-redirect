Provides page redirection back to non-secured pages (https: to http:)

# Description 

This plugin was developed to solve a redirection issue when navigating from a secured checkout page back to
a non-secured page (or page that you need to have as non-secured---possibly because of non-secured
external links, etc.)

For example, a user comes to your wordpress e-commerce site, locates an item, then navigates to your
secured checkout page. Now the customer, realizes there is something else they need, and instead of clicking
a Continue Shopping link, then click a top category link. Since the customer is in a secured session, wordpress
put the secured protocol on all the links including that category. Now the customer navigates to that
category, but they are still in a secured page session. Now this category page is displaying improperly because
of some external links that did not translate properly into the secured session. Customer is now upset, thinking
that the site design demonstrates the level of incompetence of the shop owner and questions the shop owner's 
integrity to fulfill the customer's order, so the customer in a behavior of discuss, rapidly leaves the
shop owner's site and that customer becomes a non-customer!

This plugin resolves this issue by redirecting all non specified checkout (and other non-secured pages)
back to a non-secured page counterpart.
